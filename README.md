# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
These are all the projects I created while following Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI course. The course spreads 19 projects + 7 challenge projects over 100 days, where each day takes about 1-2 hours to complete. The projects in this repo are almost the same as those in the course with two exceptions.

### Challenge features
At the end of each project, Hudson provides a few challenge features that we could implement in our projects but gives no coding solutions for them besides a few hints. On most of the later projects, this means that the implementation of the challenge features will be largely unique.

### Challenge projects
Every 3-4 projects, Hudson includes a "Challenge" Day where he provides a rough outline of the app that we're supposed to make alongside some tips. There are no coding solutions provided by the course for these challenge days either so each of these projects are almost entirely my own implementation. From the repo, these are the challenge day projects:
- LengthConverter - [Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19)
- RockPaperScissors - [Day 25](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge)
- MultiplicationGame - [Day 35](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge)
- iHabit - [Day 47](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/4/3/challenge)
- FriendFace - [Day 60](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/5/3/challenge) + [Day 61](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/61)
- PhotoGallery - [Day 77](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/6/3/challenge) + [Day 78](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/78)
- DiceSimulator - [Day 95](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/7/3/challenge)

## Note of Appreciation
This course by Paul Hudson is an amazing way to learn SwiftUI even for beginners with zero coding experience. After completing this course, I feel that I have a solid base knowledge of how the SwiftUI framework functions and am confident that I can learn more advanced SwiftUI concepts more easily as a result of this course.
